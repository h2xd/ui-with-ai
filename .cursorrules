- Format: <type>(<scope>)!: <summary>
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Scopes: app, components, lib, mcp, ui, hooks, api
- Breaking: add ! or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
- PR titles must follow the same format
- Try to avoid a body and make a short headline
